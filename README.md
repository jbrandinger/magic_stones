# Magic Stones

A C++ implementation of two classic algorithms: the Magic Stones dynamic programming problem and an inversion counting algorithm using modified merge sort.

## Overview

This project implements solutions to two computational problems:

1. **Magic Stones Problem**: Find the minimum number of magic stones required to defeat a dragon with a given health, where each stone deals a specific amount of damage.
2. **Count Flips (Inversions)**: Count the number of inversions in an array using a modified merge sort algorithm.
